However, the capability of finite automata to model the system data is quite limited and, in many cases, extended finite state machine formalisms, that combine the system control with data structures, are used instead. The application of Angluin-style inference algorithms to extended state machines would involve constructing a minimal deterministic extended finite state machine consistent with a deterministic 3-valued deterministic finite automaton. In addition to the usual, accepting and rejecting, states of finite automaton, a 3-valued deterministic finite automaton may have “don't care” states; the sequences of inputs that reach such states may be considered as accepted or rejected, as is convenient. The aforementioned construction reduces to finding a minimal deterministic finite automaton consistent with a 3-valued deterministic finite automaton, that preserves the deterministic nature of the extended model that also handles the data structure associated with it. This paper investigates fundamental properties of extended finite state machines in relation to Angluin's language inference problem and provides an inference algorithm for such models.","tags":[],"title":"Fundamental results for learning deterministic extended finite state machines from queries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian Gheorghe","Raluca Lefticaru","Savas Konur","Ionut Mihai Niculescu","Henry N.

These models combine sequences of observable actions and the passing of (discrete) time and can be used to specify a number of classes of reactive systems, an example being robotic systems. We use implementation relations in order to formally define a notion of correctness of a system under test (SUT) with respect to a specification. As usual, the aim is to devise an extension of the classical ioco implementation relation but available timed variants of ioco are not suitable for cyclic models. This paper thus defines new implementation relations that encapsulate the discrete nature of time and take into account not only the actions that models can perform but also the ones that they can refuse. In addition to defining these relations, we study a number of their properties and provide alternative characterisations, showing that the relations are appropriate conservative extensions of trace containment. Finally, we give test derivation algorithms and prove that they are sound and also are complete in the limit.","tags":[],"title":"Implementation relations and testing for cyclic systems with refusals and discrete time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony J.

These qualities make the method attractive for software certification, especially in the domain of brokered cloud services, where arbitrage seeks to substitute functionally equivalent services from alternative providers. However, practical obstacles include the difficulty in providing a correct specification, the translation of abstract paths into feasible concrete tests and the large size of generated test suites. We describe a novel SXM verification and testing method, which automatically checks specifications for completeness and determinism, prior to generating complete test suites with full grounding information. Three optimization steps achieve up to a 10-fold reduction in the size of the test suite, removing infeasible and redundant tests. The method is backed by a set of tools to validate and verify the SXM specification, generate technology-agnostic test suites and ground these in SOAP, REST or rich-client service implementations.

On the other hand, model checking has been used far less in other software engineering activities, such as model design and software testing. In this paper we propose an automated model design strategy, by integrating genetic algorithms (used for model generation) with model checking (used to evaluate the fitness, which takes into account the satisfied/unsatisfied specifications). Genetic programming is the process of evolving computer programs, by using a fitness value determined by the program's ability to perform a given computational task. This evaluation is based on the output produced by the program for a set of training input samples. The consequence is that the evolved program can function well for the sample set used for training, but there is no guarantee that the program will behave properly for every possible input. Instead of training samples, in this paper we use a model checker, which verifies if the generated model satisfies the specifications. This approach is empirically evaluated for the generation of finite state-based models. Furthermore, the previous fitness function proposed in the literature, that takes into account only the number of unsatisfied specifications, presents plateaux and so does not offer a good guidance for the search. This paper proposes and evaluates the performance of a number of new fitness functions, which, by taking also into account the counterexamples provided by the model checker, improve the success rate of the genetic algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Model Design Using Genetic Algorithms and Model Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raluca Lefticaru","Florentin Ipate","Marian Gheorghe","Gexiang Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251068400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251068400,"objectID":"24243bb9bd86c82d1c398693039069be","permalink":"https://ralucalefticaru.github.io/publication/2009_wmc/","publishdate":"2009-08-24T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_wmc/","section":"publication","summary":"P systems are employed in various contexts to specify or model different problems.

On the other hand, such techniques could be employed in functional test generation if an explicit, graph-based, model, that describes the algorithm used to produce the required results, existed. However, the process of creating and validating such a model is usually a highly-specialized and time consuming task, which quite often cannot be economically justified in the case of non-safety-critical applications. In this paper we propose a framework for genetic model based testing. Under this framework, a graph-based model of the system under test is built using a genetic algorithm. Test data is then derived from the resulting model using (possibly) metaheuristic search techniques to provide the desired level of coverage.

We show that functional testing of a class can be reduced to state-based testing, provided that the right state model is produced. We present a strategy for constructing a state diagram for a class method, based on a domain partition derived through functional techniques.
