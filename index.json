Functional testing using EFSMs can be a difficult process for two reasons: path feasibility and path input data generation. In this paper we propose a search based approach to produce a feasible path in a given EFSM. Our method searches for a path that is feasible but not very easy to traverse, using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with a feasibility metric based on dataflow dependencies as a fitness function. The purpose of the algorithm is to find those test cases that traverse some difficult to reach transitions or combinations of transitions and those might not be covered by other testing methods, so using a set of this kind of test cases is very important in the testing process.","tags":[],"title":"Generating Complex Paths for Testing from an EFSM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erzsébet Csuhaj-Varjú","Marian Gheorghe","Raluca Lefticaru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531004400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531004400,"objectID":"3f415fc782f0b3a4ec3a1c53867e137b","permalink":"/publication/2018_p_colonies/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_p_colonies/","section":"publication","summary":"P colonies, tissue-like P systems with very simple components, have received constant attention from the membrane computing community and in the last years several new variants of the model have been considered.

In this paper we study connections among several classes of P colonies and kernel P systems, by showing how the behaviour of these P colony systems can be represented as kernel P systems. An example illustrates the way it is modelled by using P colonies and kernel P systems and some properties of it are formally proved in the latter approach.","tags":[],"title":"P colonies and kernel P systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian Gheorghe","Rodica Ceterchi","Florentin Ipate","Savas Konur","Raluca Lefticaru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525820400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525820400,"objectID":"5581d92174ad8ee3463a2bd351f7f89e","permalink":"/publication/2018_tcs/","publishdate":"2018-05-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_tcs/","section":"publication","summary":"A kernel P system integrates in a coherent and elegant manner some of the most successfully used features of the P systems employed in modelling various applications.

We also show how formal verification can be used to validate that the given models work as desired.

Guaranteeing that the models utilised meet the specified requirements is beneficial in detecting misbehaviour and software flaws. This requires an integrated approach, combining verification and model-based testing methodology and notations and methods from system engineering and software engineering. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach integrating various notations utilised in the functional design of complex systems with formal verification and testing.
